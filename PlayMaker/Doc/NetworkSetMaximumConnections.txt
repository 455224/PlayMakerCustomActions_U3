Set the maximum amount of connections/players allowed.

This cannot be set higher than the connection count given in Launch Server.

Setting it to 0 means no new connections can be made but the existing ones stay connected.

Setting it to -1 means the maximum connections count is set to the same number of current open connections. In that case, if a players drops then the slot is still open for him.</p>
