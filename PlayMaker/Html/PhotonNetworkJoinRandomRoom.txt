Max Player in rooms to filter. Leave to 0 if you don't want to filter by players numbers in rooms
-- FillRoom (Default): Fills up rooms (oldest first) to get players together as fast as possible.Makes most sense with MaxPlayers > 0 and games that can only start with more players.
-- SerialMatching: Distributes players across available rooms sequentially but takes filter into account. Without filter, rooms get players evenly distributed.
-- RandomMatching: Joins a (fully) random room. Expected properties must match but aside from this, any available room might be selected.</div>
